# Vite + Vue 3 + Typescript + Tailwind Starter

Simple, opinionated, **fully typed**, and **production-ready** project template for Vite.

This template is **practical** and **batteries included** but not overly complex or bloated. Also explicit configuration over magic; it should be easy to understand how everything works, strip out anything you don't need, and fast to modify things to your needs.

Includes plenty of **examples and documentation** of how to do things but **minimal cruft** to delete to get you going.

Please [check out the homepage](https://vite-ts-tailwind-starter.vercel.app/) for full docs. A [detailed changelog](./CHANGES.md) is available. This repository is also [mirrored on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/uninen/vite-ts-tailwind-starter).
